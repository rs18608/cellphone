# Cell Phone Usage Report
Quick effort for the Cell Phone Usage Report

### Description
The general idea with this code is to read in the data files (.csv) into a database structure and then generate a summary report.
The code is incomplete as far as the final requirements are concerned, but the basic functionality is there meaning.

1.  Data for the two data source files (CellPhone.csv and CellPhoneUsageByMonth.csv) are loaded direction into an in memory SQL database
with two tables CELL_PHONE and CELL_USAGE.  Again data is loaded directly into these tables.

2.  Step 1. then enables enables queries to generate reports.   I have included a quick examples of this.

3.  The project contains to primary source files that should be obvious how things are laid out.
